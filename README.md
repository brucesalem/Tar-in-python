# Tar in Python
Based in use of the tarfile module from Stackoverflow eamples. I wrote exhancema
ents to make this a working program. It uses the OS and datetime modules to get arguments from the shell and to namethe tarfile with the current date. I is involved with the filenames in the current dir to be backup up.
